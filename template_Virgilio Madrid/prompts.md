#prompt2


i want you to create the necessary html, css, and js files to build a stopwatch/countdown app. I want you to use the image as reference for the app. It should have 3 pages (main menu, stopwatch, and countdown). Main Menu should have 2 butttons/icons: the stopwatch and the countdown. The Stopwatch page should have the start/pause button, clear button, and the counter(hh:mm:ss) counting up. The Stopwatch page should have a numeric pad to insert the numbers into (hh:mm:ss) from right to left.... it should also have a set button, and a clear button, and the counter(hh:mm:ss) counting down. Please create a 3 paragraph strategy and ask the questions you consider before starting
