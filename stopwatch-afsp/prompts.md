# Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Take the role of a experienced senior web developer. Using html and js, I want to build a stopwatch and a countdown watch.

First of all, we need a toogle to switch between stopwatch and countedown watch.

In stopwatch mode, the timer will start at "00:00:00" and increase time. Follow the image to build the UI and change start with pause on press.

In countdown watch mode, the timer will start at the time given by user. Follow the image to build the UI and change start with pause on press. 

It must be similar to the image provided. The output must only be the code without explanations in the files index.html and script.js
